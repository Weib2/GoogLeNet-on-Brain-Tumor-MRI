# GoogLeNet-on-Brain-Tumor-MRI

How to run the code:


Download the correct version of conda, cuDNN, tensorflow take a few day for me to do the research.


1.Download Anaconda and install. Create the virtual envirment.

2.Install conda, cuDNN , Kears and other library.

3.When installing tensorflow, be care the version of the tensorflow, as it might not work for you GPU. I have tried a lot.

4.Install jupter notebook.

5.And you should be able to run.




The GoogLeNet Mordel is base on the: Le, K. (2023, December 19). 
Implementation of GoogLeNet on Keras - Khuyen Le - Medium. Medium. https://lekhuyen.medium.com/implementation-of-googlenet-on-keras-d9873aeed83c


Because I could't found any GoogLeNet is not pretrained. So I followed on the build. 

For the data input and preprocessing part, I have done a lot of reaserch, most of them builds the similar, so I made some of the steps faster or with different method to turned to my own code.
